Welcome to a brief demo of RAYMAN, the adventure platform game that has 
everyone raving! 
This demo contains one interactive playable demo taken from The Dream Forest 
world of the full version of the game, and several non-interactive looping 
demos that will show you a bit of the rest of Rayman's wild world.

To run:
1. Open File Manager from the Windows main screen
2. Click on the icone representing your CD-ROM drive (usually D:)
3. Open the RAYMAN folder by clicking on it twice
4. Click twice on the file called RAYMAN.EXE

Keyboard Controls:
Letter X: Make a face
CTRL key: Jump
ALT key: Fist -- the longer you hold the key the farther you punch.

If you do not touch the joypad for several minutes, the non-interactive 
looping demos will begin.
